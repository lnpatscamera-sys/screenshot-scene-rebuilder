## LNPATS ERP rules
- Subdirectories have their own AGENTS.md (src/lib/AGENTS.md); read it before changing files there.
- AuthProvider owns the single auth-state listener and notifies the router only on identity changes or user updates; repeated SIGNED_IN events must not invalidate routes. Why: protected route validation can emit SIGNED_IN and otherwise cause a request loop.
- Approval workflows (leave, supply) advance only via SECURITY DEFINER functions `act_on_leave`/`act_on_supply`; stage→role maps are mirrored in `src/lib/workflow.ts` — keep both in sync. Why: clients cannot update workflow rows directly.
- Attach `audit_trigger` to every business table. Why: all actions must be audited.
- Roles live in `user_roles`; `system_admin` passes every `has_any_role` check.
- Keep existing identity, names, inventory, and workflow columns canonical; alternate uploaded SQL names are generated read-only columns or security-invoker views. Why: no duplicate state/bypasses.
- Newly staged ERP modules are system-admin-only with RLS, explicit grants, and audit triggers until module-specific permissions are implemented. Why: schema preparation must not expose personnel, financial, or disciplinary records.
- Preserve full names without automatic splitting. Why: no invented data.
- Share police rank choices via `src/lib/police-ranks.ts`; retain historical values and separate ranks from roles. Why: consistency.
- Phase 2 correspondence/documents mutate via authorized RPCs, share query/report controls and one registry for both directions; private attachments use exact path membership and signed links. Why: read access never implies approval or file access.
- App emails use the managed server-only template sender, with no local queue or generic send endpoint; email preview routes bypass app guards and authenticate themselves. Why: central delivery.
- Receipts, issues, and reconciliations post stock atomically under inventory row locks and generate immutable source-linked movements; supply collection creates its issue only through its authorized workflow RPC. Other logistics histories remain staged; suppliers and equipment request items stay read-only projections. Why: prevents duplicate stock changes, approval bypasses, and divergent identities.
- Logistics: supplier edits target vendors, equipment requests reuse the supply workflow; supplier/asset/booking writes stay system-admin-only. Why: no parallel identities or permission expansion.
- Stock AI analysis checks storekeeper access server-side, uses item-scoped evidence and never posts stock.
- Training module reads share `trainingOptions`; graduation decisions and certificate issuance happen only through the `graduate_cadet` RPC, and result grades are computed by the `compute_assessment_grade` trigger (mirrored by `gradeFor` in `src/lib/training.ts`). Why: keeps certificates atomic with approvals and grades consistent between UI and database.
- Finance workflow state (status, stage, history, approved/used amounts) changes only through the SECURITY DEFINER `finance_workflow` RPC, enforced by `guard_finance_state`; stage→role maps and the high-value threshold are mirrored in `src/lib/finance.ts`. Why: clients cannot self-approve or alter balances.
- Procurement screens share paginated procurementOptions; requests use finance_workflow, and order/receipt/contract transitions use procurement_action. Why: preserves canonical approvals and atomic inventory/expense posting without parallel state.
- HR extends canonical officers, attendance, promotions and disciplinary_actions; hrOptions feeds its protected screens and hr_action authorizes personnel decisions. Private hr-files use exact parent-record membership, with no file deletion; HR leave uses workflow_kind on canonical leave_requests and act_on_leave. Why: avoids duplicate personnel, file loss and approval bypasses.
- Command: reports snapshot reviewer names from canonical supervisors/section heads and command appointments; reports, compilations and versioned command supplies change only through authorized RPCs with exact-membership private files; supplies reserve canonical stock after final approval, keep Legacy stages, post via existing procurement/GRN and stock-issue paths, and need requester acknowledgment plus Logistics confirmation at pickup; oversight reads use protected aggregate RPCs, never widened policies; timed notifications are per-recipient and idempotent. Why: approvals stay immutable, stock posts once, and oversight never exposes sensitive records.
- Facility work orders change state only via `facility_action`; ISS records are iss_officer-writable, command-readable. Why: no self-completed work; restricted security logs.
- Only HR opens accounts via `enrollStaff` (signup disabled); `signInWithLnpId` resolves email server-side, never returning it; `must_change_password` metadata gates the app. Why: HR-controlled enrollment without exposing emails.
- Biometric devices push to /api/public/attendance/hikvision/$deviceId with a hashed per-device token; punches are immutable, roster status derives from src/lib/attendance.ts. Why: cloud can't poll LAN; no manual edits.
- Staff file numbers (stored in canonical form_number), official emails (assigned addresses only, no mailbox provisioning) and retirement dates are set by the hr_personnel_derive trigger; retirementDateFor in src/lib/hr-enrollment.ts mirrors it. Why: users cannot edit derived identity fields.
- Officer queries that embed office or section names must name the relation (`sections!officers_section_id_fkey`, `offices!officers_office_id_fkey`) because sections.section_head also references officers. Why: an ambiguous embed makes the read fail, leaving officer screens stuck loading or empty.
- Official Mail inbox talks IMAP/SMTP to the cPanel host over node:tls via src/lib/mail.server.ts; mailbox passwords are AES-GCM encrypted (MAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY) in owner-only mail_accounts, and HTML mail renders in a script-less sandboxed iframe. Why: per-officer privacy and safe display of untrusted email.
